      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="legal-meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

      <div class="legal-content">
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Thermo Cycles ("the App") handles information when you use the App. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Thermo Cycles does NOT collect, store, transmit, or process any personal data, personally identifiable information (PII), or user-generated content. All thermodynamic calculations are performed entirely on your device.</p>
        <p>Specifically, we do NOT collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Names, email addresses, or contact information.</li>
          <li>Location or geolocation data.</li>
          <li>Device identifiers or fingerprints.</li>
          <li>Calculation inputs or results.</li>
          <li>Usage patterns or behavioral data.</li>
          <li>Photos, files, or any other user content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>The App stores a small amount of preference data locally on your device using standard platform storage mechanisms (SharedPreferences/UserDefaults). This data includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Language preference selection.</li>
          <li>In-app purchase verification status.</li>
          <li>App configuration settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is stored exclusively on your device, is not transmitted anywhere, and is not accessible by the developer or any third party. This data is automatically deleted when you uninstall the App.</p>

        <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>a) Purchase transactions are processed exclusively by the respective platform store (Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or Microsoft Store).</p>
        <p>b) The developer does NOT have access to, process, or store any payment information, credit card details, billing addresses, or financial data.</p>
        <p>c) For information about how your platform store handles payment data, please refer to their respective privacy policies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Apple: <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.apple.com/privacy/</a></li>
          <li>Google: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
          <li>Microsoft: <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://privacy.microsoft.com/</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
        <p>The App does NOT use any:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Analytics frameworks or services (no Google Analytics, Firebase, Mixpanel, etc.).</li>
          <li>Advertising SDKs or ad networks.</li>
          <li>Crash reporting services.</li>
          <li>User tracking or profiling tools.</li>
          <li>Cookies or similar tracking technologies.</li>
          <li>A/B testing frameworks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your usage of the App is completely private and unmonitored.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The only third-party integration is the platform's native in-app purchase system, which is used solely for processing optional purchases to unlock additional cycle calculators. No other third-party services, SDKs, or libraries that collect data are used.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any data, we do not share, sell, rent, trade, or otherwise disclose any personal information to third parties. We will never:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sell your data to advertisers or data brokers.</li>
          <li>Share data with social media platforms.</li>
          <li>Provide data to marketing companies.</li>
          <li>Use your data for targeted advertising.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Because the App processes all data locally and does not transmit any data over the internet (except for in-app purchase verification handled by the platform), there is no risk of data breaches from our servers. Locally stored preferences are protected by your device's built-in security measures.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is suitable for users of all ages. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regarding children's data, and other applicable children's privacy laws. Since we do not collect any personal data from any users, we inherently comply with all children's privacy requirements.</p>

        <h2>9. International Users</h2>
        <p>The App does not transmit data across borders. All data processing occurs locally on your device regardless of your location. The sections below describe how the App complies with data protection laws in specific jurisdictions.</p>

        <h2>10. European Economic Area (EU/EEA) &mdash; General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
        <p><strong>Data Controller:</strong> The developer of Thermo Cycles is the data controller for the purposes of the GDPR. Contact details are provided in Section 20 below.</p>
        <p><strong>Lawful Basis for Processing:</strong> The only data processing that occurs is the storage of app preferences on your device, which is strictly necessary for the App to function (Article 6(1)(b) &mdash; performance of a contract). No consent is required for this processing as it does not involve personal data transmitted to or accessible by the developer.</p>
        <p><strong>Your Rights Under GDPR:</strong> Since we do not collect, store, or have access to any personal data, rights under Articles 15&ndash;22 of the GDPR (access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection, and automated decision-making) are inherently satisfied. To delete locally stored preferences, simply uninstall the App.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Protection Officer:</strong> Given that the App does not process personal data, the appointment of a Data Protection Officer is not required under Article 37 of the GDPR.</p>
        <p><strong>Cross-Border Transfers:</strong> No personal data is transferred outside your device. There are no international data transfers to declare.</p>

        <h2>11. United Kingdom &mdash; UK GDPR &amp; Data Protection Act 2018</h2>
        <p><strong>Data Controller:</strong> The developer of Thermo Cycles is the data controller for the purposes of the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
        <p><strong>Lawful Basis for Processing:</strong> As with the EU GDPR, the only processing is local storage of app preferences, which is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and the developer (Article 6(1)(b) UK GDPR).</p>
        <p><strong>Your Rights Under UK GDPR:</strong> Since no personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted, your rights under the UK GDPR (including the right of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, and objection) are inherently fulfilled. To remove locally stored preference data, uninstall the App from your device.</p>
        <p><strong>ICO Compliance:</strong> The App is designed to comply with guidance issued by the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). Since no personal data is processed, no ICO registration is required under the current fee framework. If you have concerns about how the App handles data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the ICO at <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Age Appropriate Design Code:</strong> The App does not collect personal data from any users, including children. It does not use profiling, nudge techniques, or data-driven recommendation systems. The App is therefore compliant with the ICO's Age Appropriate Design Code (Children's Code) by design.</p>

        <h2>12. California, USA &mdash; California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA).</p>
        <p><strong>Categories of Personal Information Collected:</strong> None. We do not collect, sell, or share personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA.</p>
        <p><strong>Right to Know, Delete, Correct, and Opt-Out:</strong> Since we do not collect personal information, these rights are inherently respected. We have no data to disclose, delete, correct, or from which to opt you out.</p>
        <p><strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> We do not discriminate against any user for exercising their privacy rights.</p>
        <p><strong>Shine the Light (California Civil Code &sect; 1798.83):</strong> We do not disclose personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.</p>

        <h2>13. Brazil &mdash; Lei Geral de Prote&ccedil;&atilde;o de Dados (LGPD)</h2>
        <p>If you are located in Brazil, the LGPD grants you certain rights regarding your personal data.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Processing Agent:</strong> The developer of Thermo Cycles acts as the data processing controller under the LGPD.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> The minimal local storage of app preferences is based on the legitimate interest of ensuring the App functions correctly (Article 7, X, LGPD). No personal data is collected, transmitted, or shared.</p>
        <p><strong>Your Rights Under LGPD:</strong> Since no personal data is collected or processed beyond your device, your rights under Articles 17&ndash;22 of the LGPD (confirmation, access, correction, anonymisation, deletion, portability, information about sharing, and revocation of consent) are inherently fulfilled.</p>
        <p><strong>ANPD:</strong> If you have concerns, you may contact Brazil's National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) at <a href="https://www.gov.br/anpd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gov.br/anpd</a>.</p>

        <h2>14. Canada &mdash; Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)</h2>
        <p>If you are located in Canada, PIPEDA and applicable provincial privacy legislation govern the handling of your personal information.</p>
        <p><strong>Accountability:</strong> The developer is accountable for all personal information under their control. Since no personal information is collected or transmitted by the App, this obligation is met by design.</p>
        <p><strong>Consent:</strong> No personal information is collected, therefore no consent is required or sought.</p>
        <p><strong>Your Rights Under PIPEDA:</strong> You have the right to request access to and correction of your personal information. Since we hold no personal information, these rights are inherently satisfied.</p>
        <p><strong>OPC:</strong> If you have concerns, you may contact the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada at <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">priv.gc.ca</a>.</p>

        <h2>15. Australia &mdash; Privacy Act 1988 &amp; Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)</h2>
        <p>If you are located in Australia, the Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) govern how personal information is handled.</p>
        <p><strong>APP Compliance:</strong> The App does not collect, use, disclose, or store personal information as defined under the Privacy Act 1988. All data processing occurs locally on your device. The App complies with all 13 APPs by design, as no personal information is handled.</p>
        <p><strong>Your Rights:</strong> You have the right to access and correct personal information held about you. Since we do not hold any personal information, these rights are inherently satisfied.</p>
        <p><strong>OAIC:</strong> If you have concerns, you may contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner at <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oaic.gov.au</a>.</p>

        <h2>16. Japan &mdash; Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI)</h2>
        <p>If you are located in Japan, the APPI governs how personal information is handled. The App does not collect, acquire, hold, or transfer personal information as defined under the APPI. All processing occurs locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>17. South Korea &mdash; Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)</h2>
        <p>If you are located in South Korea, PIPA governs the handling of personal information. The App does not collect, process, or transfer personal information as defined under PIPA. All data processing occurs locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>18. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App does not collect personal data from any user of any age. We comply with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>COPPA</strong> (USA) &mdash; Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</li>
          <li><strong>UK Age Appropriate Design Code</strong> (Children's Code) &mdash; issued by the ICO.</li>
          <li><strong>GDPR Article 8</strong> &mdash; conditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information society services.</li>
          <li><strong>LGPD</strong> (Brazil) &mdash; provisions regarding the processing of children's and adolescents' personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since no personal data is collected from any users, we inherently comply with all children's privacy requirements globally.</p>

        <h2>19. Do Not Track</h2>
        <p>The App does not track users in any way and therefore inherently honors "Do Not Track" signals, Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals, and similar mechanisms.</p>

        <h2>20. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected within the App and on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>21. Contact</h2>
        <p>For privacy-related questions, concerns, or requests under any jurisdiction, please contact the developer through the app store listing.</p>
        <p>If you believe your data protection rights have been violated, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection supervisory authority.</p>
