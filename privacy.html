      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="legal-meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

      <div class="legal-content">
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Thermo Cycles ("the App") handles information when you use the App. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Thermo Cycles does NOT collect, store, transmit, or process any personal data, personally identifiable information (PII), or user-generated content. All thermodynamic calculations are performed entirely on your device.</p>
        <p>Specifically, we do NOT collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Names, email addresses, or contact information.</li>
          <li>Location or geolocation data.</li>
          <li>Device identifiers or fingerprints.</li>
          <li>Calculation inputs or results.</li>
          <li>Usage patterns or behavioral data.</li>
          <li>Photos, files, or any other user content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>The App stores a small amount of preference data locally on your device using standard platform storage mechanisms (SharedPreferences/UserDefaults). This data includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Language preference selection.</li>
          <li>In-app purchase verification status.</li>
          <li>App configuration settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is stored exclusively on your device, is not transmitted anywhere, and is not accessible by the developer or any third party. This data is automatically deleted when you uninstall the App.</p>

        <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>a) Purchase transactions are processed exclusively by the respective platform store (Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or Microsoft Store).</p>
        <p>b) The developer does NOT have access to, process, or store any payment information, credit card details, billing addresses, or financial data.</p>
        <p>c) For information about how your platform store handles payment data, please refer to their respective privacy policies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Apple: <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.apple.com/privacy/</a></li>
          <li>Google: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
          <li>Microsoft: <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://privacy.microsoft.com/</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
        <p>The App does NOT use any:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Analytics frameworks or services (no Google Analytics, Firebase, Mixpanel, etc.).</li>
          <li>Advertising SDKs or ad networks.</li>
          <li>Crash reporting services.</li>
          <li>User tracking or profiling tools.</li>
          <li>Cookies or similar tracking technologies.</li>
          <li>A/B testing frameworks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your usage of the App is completely private and unmonitored.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The only third-party integration is the platform's native in-app purchase system, which is used solely for processing optional purchases to unlock additional cycle calculators. No other third-party services, SDKs, or libraries that collect data are used.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any data, we do not share, sell, rent, trade, or otherwise disclose any personal information to third parties. We will never:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sell your data to advertisers or data brokers.</li>
          <li>Share data with social media platforms.</li>
          <li>Provide data to marketing companies.</li>
          <li>Use your data for targeted advertising.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Because the App processes all data locally and does not transmit any data over the internet (except for in-app purchase verification handled by the platform), there is no risk of data breaches from our servers. Locally stored preferences are protected by your device's built-in security measures.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is suitable for users of all ages. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regarding children's data, and other applicable children's privacy laws. Since we do not collect any personal data from any users, we inherently comply with all children's privacy requirements.</p>

        <h2>9. International Users</h2>
        <p>The App does not transmit data across borders. All data processing occurs locally on your device regardless of your location. For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), the App complies with GDPR requirements by design, as no personal data is collected or processed.</p>

        <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal data, rights typically associated with data protection regulations (such as the right to access, rectification, erasure, portability, and objection under GDPR) are inherently satisfied. If you wish to delete locally stored preferences, simply uninstall the App.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected within the App with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>12. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act. Since we do not collect, sell, or share personal information, these rights are inherently respected.</p>

        <h2>13. Do Not Track</h2>
        <p>The App does not track users in any way and therefore inherently honors "Do Not Track" signals and similar mechanisms.</p>

        <h2>14. Contact</h2>
        <p>For privacy-related questions, concerns, or requests, please contact the developer through the app store listing.</p>
